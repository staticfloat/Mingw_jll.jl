Moshier\n\nIt sounds vague, but as to be found at\n<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an\nimpression that the author could be willing to give an explicit\npermission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So\nprobably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\npermission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\nin MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\nversion a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\nfrom) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\n\n===================================\nHeaders and IDLs imported from Wine\n===================================\n\nSome header and IDL files were imported from the Wine project.

These don't apply to the binaries built with\nMinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\nthese parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\n\nIn addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\nCOPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\nall) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\nthis version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\npackages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\nCOPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\nlicense requirements of the MinGW runtime.\n\nIf you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\nremove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\nget linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is\neasiest and safest to just keep all the notices.\n\n\n====================\nGCC and GNU binutils\n====================\n\nCopyright (C) Free Software Foundation\nLicense: GNU GPLv3+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv3)\n\n\n==============\nProfiling code\n==============\n\nCopyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Red Hat, Inc.\nLicense: GNU GPLv2+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv2)\n\n        *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCopyright (c) 1982, 1983, 1986, 1992, 1993\n     The Regents of the University of California.

Moshier\n\nIt sounds vague, but as to be found at\n<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an\nimpression that the author could be willing to give an explicit\npermission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So\nprobably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\npermission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\nin MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\nversion a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\nfrom) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\n\n===================================\nHeaders and IDLs imported from Wine\n===================================\n\nSome header and IDL files were imported from the Wine project.

    license_text = """MinGW-w64 licensing\n*******************\n\nThe copyright and license notices have been divided in two files:\nThe notices in COPYING.MinGW-w64.txt (this file) apply only to\nMinGW-w64 itself. These don't apply to the binaries built with\nMinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\nthese parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\n\nIn addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\nCOPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\nall) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\nthis version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\npackages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\nCOPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\nlicense requirements of the MinGW runtime.\n\nIf you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\nremove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\nget linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is\neasiest and safest to just keep all the notices.\n\n\n====================\nGCC and GNU binutils\n====================\n\nCopyright (C) Free Software Foundation\nLicense: GNU GPLv3+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv3)\n\n\n==============\nProfiling code\n==============\n\nCopyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Red Hat, Inc.\nLicense: GNU GPLv2+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv2)\n\n        *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCopyright (c) 1982, 1983, 1986, 1992, 1993\n     The Regents of the University of California.
